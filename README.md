# wayland client utility library

This library wraps much code as possible for writing a wayland client, it comes
with **nuklear** GUI library and its lua bindings.

The lua bindings should works similar to [LÃ–VE-nuklear](https://github.com/keharriso/love-nuklear/)

## TODOs
- nk_layout implementation (solve the ratio parameters)
- rest of the bindings
