* Client side work
* [%] refactoring works
** TODO change the ~nk_wl_impl_*~ calls
   This allows the client to have multiple gui windows at its disposal. Or a
   simple fullscreen application.
** TODO the drawing of complex applications.
   You never tried one, I mean, never actually tried the complex programs.

* [0%] BUGS
** TODO twclient leak
   There are currently leaks in the use of `xkbcommon` and `wl_get_keyboard`. I
   called the corresponding destructor but there are still leaks.
** repeated key in the non edit environment
   The **textedit** seems fine but other cases have problems
